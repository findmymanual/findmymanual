    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
       <p>Welcome to Find My Manual. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of our website and services, including all features, functionality, and digital content provided through the website www.themanualroom.com. By accessing or using our website, whether as a guest or a registered user, you agree to abide by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to change or modify these Terms at any time, and continued use of the website following any updates signifies your acceptance of those changes.</p>

    <h2>1. Our Services</h2>
    <p>Find My Manual offers a centralized platform where users can search for and access digital versions of product user manuals. These manuals are available for a wide range of consumer electronics, home appliances, tools, and other items. Our aim is to provide easy access to hard-to-find manuals by either emailing them directly or providing a secure download link. While we strive to maintain a large and accurate collection, we do not guarantee that every search will return a result, and availability may vary by brand or model.</p>

    <h2>2. Payment and Manual Delivery</h2>
    <p>Some user manuals are available for free, while others require a one-time payment, typically $19.95. Payment is processed securely via our trusted third-party payment providers. Upon successful payment, the requested manual will be delivered via email, typically within a few minutes, though delays may occur due to processing or verification steps. If you do not receive your manual within a reasonable timeframe, please contact our support team. All digital sales are final once the manual has been successfully delivered.</p>

    <p>While we make every effort to ensure that the manuals provided are accurate, up-to-date, and complete, we make no warranties or representations of any kind, express or implied, regarding the availability, accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information provided.
